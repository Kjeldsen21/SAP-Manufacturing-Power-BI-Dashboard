# SAP Manufacturing & Power BI Dashboard
## Description
A group project completed as part of BMI803: Business Processes, featuring an end-to-end BI pipeline built on a SAP ERP manufacturing simulation. Raw transactional data was extracted from SAP focusing on 6 tables, modelled relationally in Power BI, and produced a 3-page executive dashboard.

Led a team of 6 with role focused on data analysis. Project weighed 25% of the final grade. Received an A.


## Project Pipeline
SAP ERP Simulation → Data Extraction → Power BI Data Model → Dashboard Creation


## Data Model

| Table | Type | Key Fields |
|---|---|---|
| **Sales** | Fact | Area, City, Country, Distribution Channel, Cost |
| **Production** | Dimension | Material Description, Month, Round |
| **Purchase Order** | Dimension | Raw Material Type, Quantity |
| **Pricing Conditions** | Dimension | Material Description, Pricing, Round |
| **Supplier Pricing** | Dimension | Raw Material Price, Raw Materials, Round |
| **Company Valuation** | Fact | Company Valuation, Profit |
| **Measures Table** | DAX Calculated | 16 custom measures |
